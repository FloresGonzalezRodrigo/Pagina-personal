                My guilt and my shame<br/>              
                Always sell me short, always feel the same<br/>
                And my face and my soul<br/>
                Always wear me thin, always under control<br/>
                But the longest hours you'll have in your life<br/>
                Are the ones you sit through to know if you're right<br/>
                So I'll wait but I pray that I'm wrong<br/>
                Because I think I know what's going on<br/>
                So let me get this straight<br/>
                The only will is my own<br/>
                I do whatever I want and stay alone<br/>
                All my decisions make it untouchable and tainted<br/>
                I'm gonna suffer for the rest of my life<br/>
                But I will always find a way to survive<br/>
                I'm not a failure but I know what it's like<br/>
                I can take it or leave it or die<br/>
                Stay, you don't always know where you stand<br/>
                'Til you know that you won't run away<br/>
                There's something inside me that feels<br/>
                Like breathing in sulfur<br/>
